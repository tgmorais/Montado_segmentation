# Montado_segmentation

Â© Copyright 2023 Tiago Morais

This repository includes the algorithm (U-net) that was developed to ortophotomap sgemnation of Montado ecosystem. 

Used scripts are in folder "train_models". The model with the highest performance is the model 2 (number of filters = 8, Dropout rate = 0.05; Batxh size = 32).
